Work flow

Beginning with HTML and within the head section, added a favicon and changed the page title. Within the body I followed semantics creating the header, a navigation bar and an about me section. Following that I started the work section as well as adding a footer with another navigation bar with copyright included. The footer has information on how to contact me and links are all working correctly from their designated place.
